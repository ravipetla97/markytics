markytics interview question
total we need 160 stocks closing prices
I opened yahoo finance  website  and checked for ADANIPORTS LAST 90 DAYS HISTORY DATA
I GOT DOWNLOAD URL FROM THAT WEBSITE
I MADE A QUERY TO GET THE DATA FROM IT
 HERE WE GOT A PROBLEM WHEN I CHECKED FOR x['SYMBOL    '][6]='ARVIND    ' its throwing an errorwithe given name it cant find any URL to download
so im using try exception method so to aviod interruptions in loop
 WE COULD ABLE TO GET ONLY 42 STOCK PRICES REMAINING NAMES ARE NOT MATCHING WITH THE URL NAMES IN WEBSITE MAY BE BECAUSE OF THE SPACES IN STOCK SYMBOS PROVIDED IN THE QESTION
  I'LL TRY TO REMOVE THE SPACES IN SYMBOLS DATA TRY TO RETRIEVE THEM
AS TODAY IS THE LAST DAY IM SENDING THIS FILE NOW I'LL UPDATE MY WORK IN FUTURE CORRESPONDENCE
THANKYOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY 

####. UPDATES. #######
I have updated the code by taking out spaces in symbol names and could able retrieve 158 closing stocks
there are some execptions throwing with  three stocks 
we could do them manually since they are few in number but ill check why those three are exceptions and update in forther correspondance
 im updating this file in github
